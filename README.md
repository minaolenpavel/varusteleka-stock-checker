# Varusteleka Stock Notifier (Obsolete)

**⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is now obsolete** – Varusteleka decided to reorganize their website, and my 2-day Python script can no longer keep up. But here it is for nostalgia, curiosity, or just a laugh.

---

## Description

This small Python project aimed to:

1. Scrape the [Varusteleka](https://www.varusteleka.com/) website for a specific product (hard-coded, because I didn’t feel like being flexible).
2. Send me a **Telegram notification** when that product was back in stock.

Basically, a tiny personal assistant for gear addicts… that doesn’t work anymore. 😅

---

## Features

* Automated scraping using **Selenium**.
* Instant **Telegram notifications**.
* Minimal configuration.
* Completed in **2 days flat**, so don’t expect a masterpiece.

---

## Usage

Back in the day:

1. Modify the script for your **Varusteleka product URL**.
2. Add your **Telegram token and chat_id**.
3. Run the script and pray Varusteleka hasn’t changed their website.

---

## Limitations

* Obsolete → doesn’t work anymore due to website changes.
* Quick-and-dirty script → code is functional but not pretty.

---

## Takeaway

A personal, 2-day project for fun with Selenium and Telegram. Now just a small geeky memory of a time when I desperately wanted to know when to buy a product before it gets out of stock.

Take a look at the code, have a laugh, and imagine a world where this actually worked.
